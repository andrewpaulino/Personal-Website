# personal-website
Made with Node.js, Handlebars, &amp; JS


## Ver 0.0.1 (ALPHA)
I will be working on this for a while, and will be adding information related to me and will hopefully have gulp enabled to utlize package 
building, for now to start:
```
cd ~/personal-website/server

nodemon or node index.js

```
Enjoy.
